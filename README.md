# Lessons

This repository contains the source code for all of the language lessons used by the Acorns project. When downloaded, the zip file when extracted is a set of Eclipse Java projects, one for each lesson type. After launching Eclipse and importing these projects, one can create a jar file that can then be incorporated into Acorns loads.
